Sensor usage is extremely battery optimized. Incremental battery consumption does not exceed 10% in typical cases. Also we strongly suggest you ensure inclusion of LBS in your T&C and Privacy Policies. By using this API you explicitly agree to our license agreement, terms and conditions and privacy policy.
